But I doubt anyone favorites his tweets ironically. Given below is his twitter ratio calculated weekly. The trend line shows that his twitter ratio has been gradually increasing at a slow rate. However, this may be because his twitter ratio was abnormally low in the first couple of weeks of his presidency. What I found more striking is the wild variations in the ratio (changes by almost 2x). I think its reflective of the chaotic nature of his presidency where a storm is always brewing anytime there is some quiet.\nGiven below are the top 25 tweets with the worst twitter ratio.\nTweet Created Replies Retweets Favorites Ratio …to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year’s Eve, and insisted on joining me.

This polarization is reflected in several states voting consistently red or blue in the presidential elections year after year. This analysis investigates several red-blue stereotypes popular in the media and measures how well they align with the actual voting patterns.\nThe plot below shows the summary of last five presidential elections. 42% of states have voted democrat in 4 or more elections, while 48% of states have voted republican in 4 or more elections. The bimodal nature of the graph is a stark reminder of the increasing schism in the country in political preference (click image to see it in higher res).\nMethodology In the sections that follow, I pick a stereotype that we suspect of red/blue biases and try to come up with an objective measure how well the bias aligns with the voting history of the state.\nIn each section, the state choropleth plot simply shows the leanings of each state colored linearly on a min-max scale. The vote differential table compares the voting history of each state with color rating of the state for that topic. The color rating of the state for that topic is derived by ranking the states and then made to fit the same distribution as the voting history (eg if there are 17 states that voted completely blue, then there would be same number of states in that exact shade for the topic distribution as well). For this reason, the shades in the choropeth might not always be same as the one in Vote Differential table.\nThe schismometer reading is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the Voting History and the topic ranking from the vote differential table and then normalized. A reading of 100 indicates complete alignment between voting and topic bias, while a rating of 0 indicates no alignment at all (meaning that topic bias colors for states line up completely randomly with their voting history).\nThis analysis only looks at the lower 48 states and doesn’t account for Alaska and Hawaii.\nHousehold income in red states is lower than blue states There is a perception that red states tend to be rural and poorer compared to blue states. 97 of the nation’s 100 poorest counties are in red states. However, comparing the median household income with voting history shows that schism to be only moderate. The nationwide state median income is about 54K. There are a fair number of states that buck the trend pushing the number lower.\nUtah and North Dakota are decidedly red, but have a fairly high median income at 63K and 60K compared to national average. New Mexico, Maine and Michigan have voted blue, but have relatively low household income at 47K, 51K and 52K. There are more hate groups in red states than blue states The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks the various hate groups operating in the country. Generally, liberals accuse conservatives of hate-mongering, while conservatives accuse liberals of being pacifists. Lets see if the stereotype holds up by comparing the hate groups per capita with the voting history.\nOverall, there seems to be a pretty good alignment between the state’s voting history and number of hate groups operating there. Mean hategroup rate in the country is 0.003 per 1000 people. Here are the outliers that go against this stereotype.\nUtah and Kansas have been decidedly red for a long time, but have relatively low hate group rate at 0.001 and 0.0017. Delaware and Vermont are democrat states, but have a high hate group rate at 0.005 and 0.0047. There are more abortion facilities in blue states This should be an easy one. Abortion rights have divided the country for over fifty years now and the red states have been known for restricting access to abortion facilities in those states. The abortion stats were gathered from the abort73 site. And as expected, the country shows a very clear divide when it comes to abortion clinics. There are about .0045 abortion facilities per 1000 people. As always, few states go against the voting trend to pull the rating down a bit.\nWyoming and Montana have voted red consistently, but have a substantially high access to clinics at 0.0077 and .005. Wisconsin has voted democrat in last five presidential elections, but still has fairly low number of clinics at 0.001 clinics per 1000 people. Obesity is more prevalent in red states This was more of a hunch coming from the fact that obesity and poverty are closely related. However, just like median household income, this schism turned out to be only moderately aligned to voting. In fact, the schismometer rating was exactly the same for median income and obesity. The median state obesity is about 30%.\nUtah, Montana and Idaho are decidedly red states, but have relatively low obesity at 24.5%, 23.6% and 28.6%. Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Oregon are blue states, but have slightly above average obesity at 30.7%, 30.8%, 32.1%, 31.2% and 30.1%. Red States prefer beer, while blue states prefer wine This hunch came to me when I did my earlier analysis, where I compared the relative beer and wine sales in the various states. The preference for beer and wine seemed to divided along party lines and this analysis shows this to true with the schism being the sharpest compared to all the other topics.\nArizona is a slightly red state, but tends to prefer wine slightly over beer. Idaho has voted red 4 out of last 5 elections and it does prefer beer, but the preference is not as strong as the other hardcore beer loving states like Mississippi. Pennsylvania and Iowa are both relatively blue states, but decidedly prefer beer over wine. Conclusion To be honest, the schismometer rating is somewhat arbitrary and its hard to know what “high” or “moderate” schism means in a real sense. The states are divided into six unequal segments depending on their voting history as shown in the first figure histogram. Mathematically, to be in the “high schism” zone, at most 25 states can break their distribution by jumping at most 1 segment. This is a fairly high bar, which causes most topics to get pushed to the moderate zone.\nAnother reason for a lot of topics moving towards moderate zone is that liberals themselves seem to be divided into two groups. States like California, Washington, New York seem to be more traditionally liberal, while States like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois are liberal in a more “blue collar” sense. The latter states seem to have a lot of red tendencies. In the same way, Utah has been traditionally red, but consistently breaks the red stereotypes. In all, other than preference for beer or wine, most of the stereotypes about red and blue states seems to be only moderately true.\nAll data and code for this analysis is available here.\n","permalink":"http://example.org/posts/divided-states-of-america/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAmerica has gotten more and more \u003ca href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/\"\u003epolitically polarized\u003c/a\u003e over the years.

Does the US state you live in prefer wine or beer? And how drunk is your state in general?

The beer wine index is calculated by dividing the wine consumption rate with beer consumption rate.\nInteresting states Washington DC tops the wine charts with per capita wine consumption that’s 2.85 times the national average. New Hampshire tops beer charts with per capita beer consumption at 1.57 times the national average. Its wine consumption is also at 2.09 times national average (second in the nation) making it the booziest state in the US. Arizona tracks the national average very closely in both wine (1.06x) and beer (1.03x). Utah is the least boozy state (yay mormons!) clocking in at 0.6 and 0.35 times the national average in beer and wine respectively.

Transformers? Lego movie? Interstellar? There’s one movie that stood head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to financial success and if you’re like me, you may have never heard of it.\nBefore digging deeper, we need to clearly define what financial success means for a movie. I took inspiration from this excellent post from Randal Olson and defined success of a movie to be the ratio of its box office earnings divided by its production costs. So a movie like Transformers might make a lot at the box office, but it also cost over 200 million dollars to make. So the Return on investment isn’t as high as you would think. Before we look at the data, few caveats:\nOnly revenues from US market was used. The worldwide revenue data is noisy, incomplete and unreliable. These numbers were collected in January 2015, so the revenues from the late 2014 movies (like Interstellar) might not be complete. The revenue and production cost data for smaller indie and limited release movies was not available. The most successful movie in 2014 The most successful movie in 2014 is small budget film called God’s not dead. Its a christian drama film about a devout evangelical christian student who confronts an atheist philosophy professor. The movie was made for 2 million and made a whopping 60 million at the box office, a 30x return on investment! This movie completely overshadows the competition and the next 2 movies are far behind (Annabelle with 12.9x and Fault in our stars with 10.4x returns). Here are the top 20 movies from 2014.\nThe most successful genres in 2014 I was also interested in finding out what genres tend to get the most bang for the buck. The boxplots below show the earnings to production cost ratios for various genres, where the line in the middle of the box indicating the median ratio for that genre. Not surprisingly, horror movies are far ahead of other genres here. Horror films tend to be cheap to make and there is a dedicated fan base who will always show up for these movies. Horror is followed by Romance, Thrillers and Comedy.\nCorrelating production cost vs rating Its probably not surprising for most folks to know that there is little correlation between production cost and the quality of the movie (pearson coefficient: 0.29). The scatter plot below shows the distribution of movie budget against its IMDB rating and you can hover over the data points to get more information.\nLarger graph here.\n\u0026lt;a href='#'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img alt='IMDB Rating vs Production budget for 2014 movies ' src='https:\u0026amp;#47;\u0026amp;#47;publicrevizit.tableausoftware.com\u0026amp;#47;static\u0026amp;#47;images\u0026amp;#47;Mo\u0026amp;#47;MovieRatings_2\u0026amp;#47;Sheet1\u0026amp;#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Learn About Tableau ","permalink":"http://example.org/posts/the-most-successful-hollywood-movies-of-2014/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo what do you think is the most successful Hollywood Movie of 2014?

The glorious uncertainties of cricket have been extolled by many a commentator over the years. In this post, I do an analysis of One Day International results to see how unpredictability in cricket has fared over the years and finally answer the question: Which is the most unpredictable team in international cricket?\nBut first, lets talk about a few rules for the analysis:\nOnly ODI results were compared. So no tests or T20s. Results tallied are for all the matches up to Dec 20, 2014. However, for time series analysis, I only took results after 1980 to avoid noise. For unpredictability analysis, I only took results after 1975. Results considered were only for matches between the following countries: Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies. I have nothing against other countries, its just that they have played enough matches to be able to do statistically significant analysis. Right then. First, a simple analysis of how interestingness of ODIs results have changed over the year. How interesting was a match can usually be gauged by how many balls remained (if the team batting second won) or what was the run margin (if the team batting first won). The graphs below show the smoothed (using loess) trendlines of how this has changed over the years (the gray area indicates the Standard Error of the metric).\nThe graphs above show a disturbing trend. If the team batting first wins, the matches are getting to be more and more boring and predictable. I think this can be attributed to cricket being dominated by batsmen and larger and larger targets being set. When the team batting second wins, the matches tend to be more interesting. The split between whether team batting first or second wins is roughly 1:1. Also, 1985-1995 was probably the most interesting period in ODI cricket.\nFinding the most unpredictable cricket team To find this, I had to first find a good measure for unpredictability. There are numerous algorithms for this, but after some research, I decided to go for Sample Entropy, which is a more robust version of Approximate Entropy. Without further ado, here are the results\nThis probably confirms the suspicion of a lot of people, but Pakistan is the most unpredictable cricket team (and they are only getting more unpredictable). Following behind closely are South Africa and India. The difference between the three is small enough that it can be attributed to noise. On the other end of the spectrum, West Indies is becoming the most predictable team (although probably not in a good way). They are followed by Australia, who have been fairly predictable and continue to be so.\nHere’s a scatter plot of Entropy with the winning percentages of the teams.\nUnpredictability in team rivalries The next logical question would be to find out which two rivalries are the most unpredictable. Unfortunately, most entropy algorithms require atleast 200-300 observations before they stabilize. So I had to settle for a more home grown solution. I created a metric that tracks the consistency of the results. So if the results keep changing over matches (eg WLWLWLWL), the team will have higher inconsistency or fluctuations and if the results are consistent over matches (eg WWWWLLLL), the team will have lower fluctuations.\nAs it turns out, Sri Lanka and England results tend to fluctuate a lot. Also (probably unsuprisingly), results from India matches seem to fluctuation a lot more than other teams.\nFinally, I want to leave you with two graphs for India and how their Balls remaining and Run Margin has changed over the years.\n","permalink":"http://example.org/posts/unpredictability-of-results-in-one-day-international-cricket-matches/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAsk any fan of any sports team and they would claim their team to be the most unpredictable with no guarantee of any result on a given day.

Some standard time series analysis techniques can be applied to this data to analyze your monthly spending habits, trends in your net worth and even predict your future net worth. In this post, I do a simple experiment on my personal finance data to break down my monthly spending habits.\nI have always been fairly lax about tracking my money. When I bought a house back in 2007, I started a simple spreadsheet where each month I added a new row tracking my assets (investments, retirement funds, bank balance etc), liabilities (mortgage, car payments, credit card bills etc) and my net worth. Thus, I have roughly 7 years worth of data at a monthly granularity. I wanted to find out more about how my net worth changes month over month. So I created a new table that had the change in net worth each month. A large positive number means either the stock market went up, or I got a bonus at work etc. A large negative number would mean a big expense or a stock market correction. The plot below shows this data. The y-axis is obfuscated for privacy.\nUnfortunately, this graph is not very useful as its very hard to figure out any trend in this noisy data. Luckily, this time series can be decomposed into trend, seasonal and random graphs to get a clearer idea of the patterns in data. The observed graph below is the original graph and can be expressed as a sum of trend, seasonal and random graphs. The trend graph shows the overall trend in month over month net worth change. The seasonal graph extracts the cyclic spending habits. The random graph accounts for large abnormalities (big stock market surge, big expense etc) in the spending habits.\nKey takeaways for me from the graph above:\nThe overall trend in month over month change in net worth is positive :) but it seems to have plateaued off since middle of 2013 :( I tend to spend a lot May-July every year (usually traveling or expense anticipating the sept bonus) as indicated by #2. The spike in #1 is probably from the annual bonus around aug-sept. The random graph is pretty accurate at capturing large expenses. #3 was due to a trip to India and #4 matches nicely with an vacation in Africa in 2012.
